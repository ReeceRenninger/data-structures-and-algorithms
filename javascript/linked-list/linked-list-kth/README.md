## Approach & Efficiency

My partner and I ended up utilizing google fu to find sample codes that were similar to what we needed to solve and adapted to what we needed. Nothing was copied. I am still practicing on understanding my Big O formula so I put our method into chatGPT to calculate and our time is O(1) and space is O(n).

## Solution

npm test linked-list , I added this method onto the original challenge as instructed.
