# Linked List

- Create a linked list that can pass all of tests listed:

    Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
    Can properly insert into the linked list
    The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
    Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
    Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
    Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
    Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

## Whiteboard Process

- This was not required for this code challenge

## Approach & Efficiency

TDD approach to resolving all of the required tests above.  This allowed for me to alter my methods within the index.js to match up to the required outputs from the tests.

## Solution

npm test linked-list

Methods were created to meet all testing parameters given for this code challenge.  Each method targeted a specific test, except the properly insert method was showcased that multiple inserts could occur so only 6 were written in total.  Each method was approached with TDD so streamline the solution process. Below you can find an image of each test running and what criteria it was aimed to solve.
